####**Q:What types of data does EGA support?**
	A: For sequences downloaded from NCBI, users can upload directly. If your data are downloaded elsewhere, process your data with the perl command we offer in the previous instruction before you upload them.
If you are using a web-based EGA, the file size is limited to 30M for each uploaded file. If you are using the local VM, there is no file size limit.
