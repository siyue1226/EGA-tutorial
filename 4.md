# Part B: Local Open-source Packed Archives

If you need to construct alignments with large-scale data, we strongly recommend you to download our virtual machine with all required dependencies installed, and run the services locally. Detailed instructions and examples are as follow.

####**Availability**
Local packed archive containing software and configuration file for local machine is available from http://114.212.172.30:3000/about/XXX.

####**Notice**
Before you start to implement, there are several things to Notice here.
1. The virtual machine could apply to windows7/windows8/windows10 systems, but it can only be deployable in a 64bit environment. If you are an apple system user, make sure your system have been upgraded to mac OS X Yosemite 10.10 or above.
2.	The configuration of virtual machine needs at least 4 GB of memory, 1 CPU quad core or dual-core CPUs with hyper-threading enabled.
3.	Try to use the recommended version of software.
4.	Some System security software might conflict with virtual machine, so please exit them before using local EGA service.

####**Instruction**

**1. Install VirtualBox:**
It is necessary to download and install VirtualBox to provide the platform to run the VM(Virtual Machine). The current version of VirtualBox is 5.0.6 for both Mac and Windows. You can obtain it for free by visiting …….

After installing VirtualBox, users are required to install the extension pack of the same version, which can be obtained by visiting……

Double click on the extension pack, it will be installed automatically into VirtualBox.

**2. Download EGA VM and import it into VirtualBox:**

**4. Visit the EGA website:**
Click on the terminal icon on the panel on the left, and run the following command :

You can visit the website in two ways:

	Either outside the VM GUI, open your browser and visit http://localhost:30080
	or, inside VM GUI, open browser and visit http://localhost:3000
**5. Follow the instructions in Part A to start your alignment.**
