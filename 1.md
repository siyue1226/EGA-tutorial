# **Introduction**

Multiple genome alignments play a fundamental role in many biological realms such as evolution and genomics. Easy Genome Aligner (EGA) is an integrated application designed to make complicated whole genome multiple alignments really accessible for most biologists.

EGA is suitable for either small or huge genomes, allowing alignments of several whole genomes, especially for large proportion of neutrally evolving regions. It has been successfully used both for closely related species and also for those across large evolutionary distance such as human and mouse. Widely used in the scientific community and servings, several validation studies have shown that the core programs of EGA are powerful methods for obtaining efficient and accurate alignments.

Two major functions of EGA are multiple genome alignment for construction of phylogenetic relationship and self-alignment for paralogous detection. The tools are available through both a web-based graphical interface and a local operating virtual machine.

To meet different needs, the application is available through both an online data analysis platform with a friendly user interface to deal with operations of smaller-scale sequence data, and a full functional virtual machine.
